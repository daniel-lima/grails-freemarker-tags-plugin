The plugin will try to expose all the TagLib artefacts, registered at grailsApplication.tagLibsClasses, as user-defined directives and functions (for implementation details, please refer to "FreeMarker FAQ":http://freemarker.sourceforge.net/docs/app_faq.html#faq_implement_function_or_macro_in_java ). These directives and functions will be defined at runtime and they will be auto-imported, using the same namespace than the source taglibs, in any FreeMarker template created further.
Some of these behaviors are "controllable" through configuration.
